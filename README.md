# Atmosphere

This repository serves as a deliberate, slow-paced accumulation of knowledge. It is designed for thorough understanding, free from haste or superficiality.

## Purpose
- To build an unparalleled and abundant source of knowledge.
- No bullshit, no cap: every entry is vetted for quality and relevance.
- Master style: methodical, boring in its rigor, producing high-quality intellectual fuel.

## Structure
- `notes/`: Individual notes and insights.
- `sources/`: References, articles, books, and external materials.
- `drafts/`: Work-in-progress thoughts.
- `archive/`: Completed or outdated materials.

Contributions are made deliberately, with emphasis on depth over breadth.
