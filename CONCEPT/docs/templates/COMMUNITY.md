# Community and Collaboration

## Channels (to be finalized via poll)
- GitHub: repository with Issues and Discussions (primary hub)
- Synchronous: Slack or Discord (poll preference)
- Mailing list: low-volume announcements

## Cadence
- Biweekly 45-min syncs
- Rolling asynchronous proposals and reviews

## Onboarding
- New participants start at README.md, CFP.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- Use Issues for tasks; Discussions for proposals; PRs for changes

## Workshop
- Public virtual workshop at cycle end; recordings and slides archived
