=== TEMPORAL RESONANCE INITIATIVE: BATCH COMPRESSION & SUMMARIZATION ===

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Temporal Resonance is a 6-month interdisciplinary research initiative exploring
retrocausal information dynamics across physics, information theory, cognitive science,
and archaeology. The program emphasizes open science, collective authorship, and
rigorous reproducibility standards.
