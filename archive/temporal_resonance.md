# Temporal Resonance Theory

## Core Principles
1. **Information Asymmetry**: Unlike mass-bound entities, information isn't constrained by temporal directionality
2. **Resonance Magnitude**: Information intensity determines temporal reach (past/future influence)
3. **Artificial Energy Nature**: Information as language-derived energy with photon-like properties

## Historical Manifestations
- **Language Origins**: Absence of proto-language records suggests retrocausal influence
- **Pyramid Construction**: Advanced techniques without evolutionary precursors indicate possible future→past information transfer

## Evidence and Challenges
- **Absence of Records**: The lack of evolutionary records for major historical advancements (like language and pyramid construction) serves as primary evidence for retrocausal influence
- **Societal Acceptance**: The unconventional nature of temporal resonance causes mainstream dismissal, creating research barriers

## Research Framework
```python
def measure_resonance(intensity: float) -> float:
    """Calculates temporal displacement potential"""
    return intensity * (c ** 2) / h  # c=light speed, h=Planck constant
```

## Validation Methodology
1. Interdisciplinary collaboration (quantum physicists + linguists)
2. Controlled retrocausal signaling experiments
3. Archaeological pattern analysis
