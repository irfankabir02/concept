# Validation and Reproducibility

## Methodology
- Define falsifiable hypotheses with measurable endpoints.
- Pre-register analysis plans when applicable.
- Prefer blinded or automated pipelines to minimize bias.

## Experimental Ideas (illustrative)
- Time-symmetric inference simulations with synthetic data.
- Reanalysis of archival datasets for retrocausal signatures with proper multiple-comparison control.
- Behavioral tasks probing information resonance effects with preregistration.

## Reproducibility Checklist
- Data and code availability
- Versioned environments
- Random seed management and report
- Power analysis / effect size reporting
- Independent replication attempts
